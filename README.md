# bouncingballs

This Application is a Pandemic Simulator, which simulates the spread of infection through a population of 250. 
The population is shown as »Bouncing Balls«. It always starts with one infected person..

BALL CHARACTERISTICS: HEALTHY - GREY / INFECTED - YELLOW / RECOVERED - BLUE / DEAD - BLACK

Every bounce of a ball from an infected ball to a healthy ball can possibly infect the uninfected ball and change 
the state of this “person”. Infected balls are further spreading the infection until they recover. 
The simulation stops when 0 infected balls are left. Got that?

1. Press START and select the Simulation Properties. 

- Select «NO PRECAUTIONS» to simulate the spread with no measures taken
- Select «SOCIAL DISTANCING» to simulate the spread with social distancing measures taken
- Select «LOCKDOWN» to simulate the spread under lockdown
- Select «LOCKDOWN WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING» to simulate the spread under both measures taken

2. Press START again, hit the play button and watch the infection spread
3. You can pause and restart the simulation anytime - hover over the buttons to show functions
4. Hit the settings button to try another simulation property 
5. Compare different measures and you will be able to see differences in terms of numbers and infection and recovery rates
