# bouncingballs

This Application is a Pandemic Simulator, which simulates the spread of infection through a population of 250. 
The population is shown as »Bouncing Balls«. It always starts with one infected person..

BALL CHARACTERISTICS: HEALTHY - GREY / INFECTED - YELLOW / RECOVERED - BLUE / DEAD - BLACK

Every bounce of a ball from an infected ball to a healthy ball can possibly infect the uninfected ball and change 
the state of this “person”. Infected balls are further spreading the infection until they recover. 
The simulation stops when there is none infected ball left. Got that?

1. Press START and select the Simulation Properties. 

- Select «NO PRECAUTIONS» to simulate the spread with no measures taken
- Select «SOCIAL DISTANCING» to simulate the spread with social distancing measures taken
- Select «LOCKDOWN» to simulate the spread under lockdown
- Select «LOCKDOWN WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING» to simulate the spread under both measures taken

2. Press START again, hit the play button and watch the infection spread
3. Watch the HISTOGRAM while the simulation continues and remember the infection rate shown in POPULATION OVER TIME 
4. To try another simulation property, hit the settings button
5. Compare different measures and you will be able to see differences in infection and recovery rates
